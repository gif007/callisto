# Callisto

This project is a web based text based adventure game written using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework. It utilizes many of Django's built in classes and functions to create a fully functional dynamic website with data persistence, user authentication, views and many other features.  It also utilizes the Fetcj API to retrieve JSON resources from the server which are then decoded and used to manipulate the DOM.
